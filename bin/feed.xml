    <title>The "Command and Control" Military Gets Agile</title>
    <link>http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/06/c2-military-gets-agile</link>
    <description>Agility is a term that is gaining traction in some very unusual places. The military is suddenly taking Agility very seriously. The military defines Agility as "the ability to successfully respond to change". The term "command and control" is used so commonly in the military that is abbreviated to "C2" in common usage. There is also a C2 Journal, which has had many articles on Agility recently. &lt;i&gt;By Dan Mezick&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <title>Article:Lambdas in Java: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
    <link>http://www.infoq.com/articles/lambdas-java-analysis</link>
    <description>Although languages like Python  and Ruby  have had lambdas for a long time, the recent popularity of JVM-based languages (notably Groovy and Scala) have rekindled demand for lambdas in Java as well. But what is a lambda and what is the proposed syntax for adding lambdas to the Java language? This article explores both of these questions in depth. &lt;i&gt;By Alex Blewitt&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <link>http://www.infoq.com/articles/5-config-mgmt-best-practices</link>
    <description>There has been a lot of conversation going on around the configuration of applications, and how to manage it. This article explores things people can do from within their code to make their lives, and the lives of anyone else who has to administer or maintain their application, easier. These patterns have been used a number of times on ThoughtWorks projects, and they have proven their worth. &lt;i&gt;By Chris Read&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <link>http://www.infoq.com/presentations/The-Limited-Red-Society</link>
    <description>Joshua Kerievsky discusses the need to reduce “red” periods of time while developing software. One is in the red when he spends too much time designing, or having compilation errors or the tests do not pass. Kerievsky demonstrates a method (Parallel Change) of reducing the red while refactoring code, and discusses another approach called Narrowed Change, and answers refactoring related questions. &lt;i&gt;By Joshua Kerievsky&lt;/i&gt;</description>
